### Your First Express and React App
Create full stack apps with React and Express. Run your client, server and do a restart of your dump db to have a full-stack project working in minutes

# Step by Step instructions - To use this project as your start point
### For create the whole project
1. Go to your source directory in your terminal and run the command `git clone https://github.com/Yosolita1978/React-Express-PairProgramming.git NAMENEWDIRECTORY`

6. Go to the client folder in the project (`cd client`) and run the command `npm install`
7. Inside your server folder, create an .env file with `touch .env`
8. Inside your server folder, open the file `.env.example` and copy the file there. 
9. Inside your .env file, paste the string from .env.example and change the variables with the values from the project. For this template, don't change the name of your db.
10. Inside your server file: run the command `psql -f db.sql` to restore the DB from the file db.sql. If it gives error, try 'psql postgres -f db.sql'
11. Inside your server file .env change it to: DB_URI="postgresql://@localhost/techtonica1" to connect to database.
